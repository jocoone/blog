Well hello there! 👋🏼

Since you are reading this blogpost it looks like you found your way to OSB. My name is Joey and started this project on a hunge. But you probably think: _"OSB WHAT NOW?"_ and you are definitely right. **OSB** stands for

## OPEN SOURCE BLOG

And actually the explanation is all in the name. The complete blog is **OPEN SOURCE**! Not only the blogposts and pages are free to read but also the `code` that creates this beautiful platform (The code can be found [here](https://github.com/jocoone/osb)). And that's not all! What makes it completely opensource is that I need your help! 👊🏻 Not only to write interesting blogposts but also to enhance **OSB** even further with cool new features! If you are a software developer you can write new pieces of code but if you are a non-software developer you can come up with brand new ideas an let us know!

This might not seem like very revolutionary but that's not the idea any way so. Since I am a software developer, sometimes I come up with a new technology or framework and like to know a little more about it. This time it was [next](https://nextjs.org/) and like most developers do when they try to learn something new, they follow the [tutorial](https://nextjs.org/learn/basics/create-nextjs-app).

During this tutorial the [next](https://nextjs.org/) take you along the explanation and the most common features of the framework and create a dummy application with you. This dummy application was a **BLOG**. Not that special you might think and that's completely true but here is some background about me.

For more then 7 years I work at a IT consultancy firm in Belgium called [Axxes](https://axxes.com/). I evolved from a young graduate to a mediocre developer and to a more senior developer with a bigger barrel of knowledge then 7 years ago. I worked on a lot of project at a lot of companies in several different businesses. So do all of my colleagues at **Axxes** so we have one thing in common: **WE CARRY A LOT OF EXPERIENCE AND KNOWLEDGE WITH US**. Last year I became a Frontend coach which basically means I have to follow up on my fellow Frontend developers and try to help them become better and stronger everyday together with my fellow coach colleagues.

## BUT THERE IS A "PROBLEM"

**The knowledge is inside our heads**. We have so many bright people working at our firm but we still sometimes struggle to share this experiences with each other. And don't get me wrong, along the years we already took a lot of steps in order to achieve all kinds of knowledge sharing. We organise knowledge sharing evenings, we organise workgroups to tackle some topics and organise internal/external conferences (Which is very big step in my opinion 💪🏻 ). But there is still a gap: _We don't write anything down._

# MEET OSB ![OSB inline](/images/logo.svg "OSB")

During the tutorial it came to me that there might be an opportunity to fill this gap so I thought: **LET'S GO**. I basically took the example application of the tutorial and enhanced it a bit so there is a bit more functionality available at hand. Then I deployed it on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) eh voila! **OSB was born**.

But then I thought: _wouldn't it be better to make the community even bigger_ so I pulled out all my company's specific logic and started to change my train of thought in order to reach the whole community. Yes you're right! **THE WHOLE COMMUNITY**. What I would like to achieve with OSB is that everybody who has something interesting to say has the possibility to share their story. It doesn't matter if you're a Software developer, Recruiter, Sales manager, Office Clerk or cleaning lady, **YOUR STORY MATTERS**. So here it is, my early new year's resolutions for 2022.

> Create a widespread knowledge/experience sharing platform that is open source, free of charge and user friendly.

You're right, it may be a bit much to begin with so let's start _small_ and dream **big**. If you have something interesting to tell or you know someone who does, you are software developer and would like to get some more experience or you have cool new ideas for the platform, don't hesitate to [contact](/contact) us. It is much appreciated!

> Let's do this together because Together Everybody Achieves More
